# Glossary Example
# Copy to ~/.claude/memory/glossary.yaml and customize for your context
#
# Entities help the memory system:
# - Recognize variations of the same thing ("GeoX" and "Regional Lift")
# - Understand organizational context (who reports to whom)
# - Track relationships between concepts
#
# When to add entries:
# - A concept has multiple names (OAuth, oauth2, "OAuth 2.0")
# - Acronyms are ambiguous or team-specific (CS&P vs CSP)
# - Project codenames exist (GeoX = Region:Lift)
# - You keep failing to find content you know exists
#
# Start small. Add entries as you encounter confusion in search results.
# A glossary of 20-50 well-chosen entities is better than 500 generic ones.
#
# Structure:
#   key: internal identifier (lowercase, underscores)
#     name: Display name
#     type: organization | person | product | project | concept
#     parent: key of parent entity (optional)
#     aliases: list of alternative names/abbreviations
