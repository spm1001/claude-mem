## What It Does

todoist-gtd is a Python CLI for Todoist that understands GTD semantics — outcomes vs actions, team priorities, waiting-fors, weekly reviews. It's designed as both a standalone CLI and a Claude Code skill, teaching Claude the vocabulary and structure needed to work with Todoist effectively. Uses OAuth for authentication with tokens stored securely in macOS Keychain.

## How It's Used

```bash
# Install
cd ~/Repos/todoist-gtd
scripts/install.sh
todoist auth      # OAuth flow (opens browser)

# CLI commands
todoist projects                    # List projects
todoist tasks --project "@Work"     # Tasks in project
todoist filter "today"              # Todoist filter syntax
todoist add "Review proposal" --project "@Work" --section "Now"
todoist done <task-id>
todoist doctor                      # Diagnose setup issues
```

**As Claude skill:** Symlink to `~/.claude/skills/todoist-gtd`

**Triggers:** "check my @Claude inbox", "what's waiting for?", "weekly review"

## Notable Patterns

1. **GTD-native:** Maps GTD concepts to Todoist — outcomes as sections, waiting-fors with labels, 3-tier priority ontology
2. **Outcome coaching:** Skill teaches Claude difference between activity language ("Review proposal") and achievement language ("Decision made on proposal")
3. **Secure auth:** OAuth tokens in Keychain (not files), client credentials gitignored, supports `--manual` for headless servers
4. **Reference docs:** Separate files for terminology, patterns, coaching — keeps SKILL.md focused while providing depth
5. **Doctor command:** Self-diagnosing CLI that checks auth, connectivity, and config issues
